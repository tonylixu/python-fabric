## Synopsis

This project contains python fabric scripts that help system administators
doing their admin works. For example, zookeeper operations, AWS web service
operations such as create DNS record, update stacks, create instances, ..etc.

Please check the fabfile directory for a complete list. Each python script is
well documented and pretty self-explanatory.

## Motivation

As a DevOps engineer, I do a lot of system administartion (operations) in my
daily work. I think it is a good thing to share some of the tools (scripts) I
use so that other people can benifit from this (hopefully)
